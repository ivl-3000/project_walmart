Project Title-: Walmart's Inventory Optimization using Python
Objective-:
•	To analyze sales data, predict inventory needs and reduce overstocking using python tools such as -: pandas, matplotlib and machine learning models.
•	Develop actionable insights to enhance operational efficiency.
Project Workflow:

1.	Import Libraries and Dataset:
•	Load necessary libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
•	Load the Walmart dataset and preview it.

3.	Data Understanding:
•	Check dataset structure: .info(), .describe(), and .shape.
•	Explore column descriptions: Identify features like date, product, store, sales, and inventory levels.

5. Feature Engineering:
•	Create new features such as: Month, Year, and Day of Week from the date column.
•	Sales Difference: Calculate week-over-week sales changes.
•	Rolling Sales Average: Smooth sales trends over time.

Key Insights
1.	Sales Trends:
•	Weekly sales exhibit significant fluctuations, primarily influenced by seasonal demand and holiday promotions.
•	Monthly sales data indicates consistent growth during holiday seasons, highlighting the importance of strategic inventory management during peak periods.
2.	Store Performance:
•	Variability in sales across stores suggests the need for tailored inventory strategies to optimize stock levels and meet local demand.
•	Identifying top-performing stores can help in replicating successful strategies across underperforming locations.
3.	Correlation Analysis:
•	Strong positive correlation between weekly sales and holiday weeks, confirming the impact of promotions.
•	Weak correlations between sales and economic indicators (CPI, Fuel Price), suggesting that other factors may play a more significant role in influencing sales.
4.	Predictive Modeling:
•	Linear Regression model demonstrated promising results with RMSE of 559,623 and MAE of 472,755, indicating the model's ability to forecast sales effectively.
•	The model can be further improved by exploring advanced machine learning techniques like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting. Actionable Insights:
•	Implementing a rolling average for sales can help in identifying trends and making informed inventory decisions.
•	Regularly updating the predictive model with new sales data can enhance accuracy and responsiveness to market changes.


Conclusion
•	Through this project, we have developed a comprehensive approach to optimize inventory management for Walmart, leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques. The insights gained can significantly enhance operational efficiency and drive better decision-making.
